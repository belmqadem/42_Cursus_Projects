## About 42 Cursus ‚ÑπÔ∏è

The 42 Cursus is a unique and intensive programming curriculum designed to foster practical coding skills through hands-on projects and challenges. This educational model emphasizes peer-to-peer learning, project-based assessments, and a focus on autonomy. Students engage in real-world coding scenarios, developing problem-solving skills and a deep understanding of software development principles.

## Projects Overview üõ†Ô∏è

The projects in this repository cover a spectrum of programming concepts, including:

- **Libft:** Building a personal library with fundamental functions.
- **ft_printf:** Creating a custom printf function to format and print output.
- **Get Next Line:** Programming a function that returns a line read from a file descriptor.
- **pipex:** A program that emulates the functionality of the shell pipe (|) in the Unix environment.
- **Push_swap:** Sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using the lowest possible number of actions.
- **So Long:** A small 2D game with minilibx. You'll learn about textures, sprites and tiles.
- **Philosophers:** A project about the basics of threading a process. You will see how to create threads and you will discover mutexes.
- **minishell:** This project is about creating a simple shell. Yes, your own little bash.
- **cub3d:** This project is inspired by the world-famous Wolfenstein 3D game, which was the first FPS ever.
- **cpp00 - cpp09:** Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming. This will be the starting point of your C++ journey
- **inception:** This project aims to broaden your knowledge of system administration by using Docker
- ...

These projects expose students to various languages, frameworks, and technologies, providing a well-rounded learning experience.

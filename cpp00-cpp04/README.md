# <div align="center"> 42 C++ Modules (CPP00 - CPP04) </div>

This repository contains my solutions and implementations for the 42 C++ Modules, from **CPP00** to **CPP04**. Each module is designed to introduce and reinforce various C++ concepts, progressively building a strong foundation in the language.

## **Modules Overview**

### **CPP00 - Basics of C++**
- **Summary**: Introduction to C++ syntax, basics of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), and differences between C and C++.
- **Topics Covered**:
  - Namespaces
  - Classes
  - Member functions
  - stdio streams
  - initialization lists
  - static, const, and some other basic stuff
- **[Directory Link](./cpp00/)**: [cpp00](./cpp00/)

---

### **CPP01 - OOP and Member Functions**
- **Summary**: Explores constructors, destructors, member functions, and the use of references, pointers, and switch statements.
- **Topics Covered**:
  - Memory Allocation
  - Pointer to members
  - References
  - Switch statement
- **[Directory Link](./cpp01/)**: [cpp01](./cpp01/)

---

### **CPP02 - Operator Overloading and Canonical Form**
- **Summary**: Covers ad-hoc polymorphism, operator overloading, and the canonical form of C++ classes for consistent object behavior.
- **Topics Covered**:
  - Ad-hoc polymorphism
  - Operator Overloading
  - Canonical Form
- **[Directory Link](./cpp02/)**: [cpp02](./cpp02/)

---

### **CPP03 - Advanced OOP Concepts**
- **Summary**: Explores inheritance and polymorphism, including virtual functions for dynamic behavior in derived classes.
- **Topics Covered**:
  - Inheritance
  - Polymorphism
  - Virtual Functions
- **[Directory Link](./cpp03/)**: [cpp03](./cpp03/)

---

### **CPP04 - Abstract classes and interfaces**
- **Summary**: Focuses on abstract classes and interfaces to define and enforce subtype polymorphism.
  - Subtype polymorphism
  - abstract classes
  - interfaces
- **[Directory Link](./cpp04/)**: [cpp04](./cpp04/)

## **How to Navigate the Repository**

Each subdirectory corresponds to a specific module (e.g., `cpp00`, `cpp01`, etc.). You can explore the exercises and projects for each module by navigating to the respective directory.

# Libft - Your First C Library

**📚 Overview:**
Libft is a fundamental project in the 42 Cursus, where the goal is to create a comprehensive C library containing essential general-purpose functions. This library becomes a vital toolkit for future C programming assignments, allowing students to better understand and implement standard functions commonly found in the C standard library.

**🎯 Key Objectives:**
- Develop a variety of functions covering different areas of programming.
- Gain insights into the implementation of standard C functions.
- Create a reusable library to enhance efficiency in future projects.

**🚀 Bonus Part:**
If you completed the mandatory part, don't hesitate to go further by adding bonus functions. This extra step offers an opportunity to earn bonus points and delve deeper into the world of list manipulation. While functions for memory and string manipulation are invaluable, mastering list manipulation provides even greater utility.

**🛠️ Enhanced Functionality:**
- Extend your library with functions for working with linked lists.
- Explore advanced list manipulation techniques.
- Implement additional features to boost the versatility of your library.

**📌 Usage Guidelines:**
- Continuously expand and improve Libft throughout the academic year.
- Ensure compatibility with project guidelines when integrating Libft into other assignments.

**🌟 Note:** The bonus part not only enhances your library's functionality but also showcases your ability to tackle more complex programming challenges. It's an excellent opportunity to demonstrate your skills and creativity.

**📁 Project Structure:**
- **libft.h:** Header file containing function prototypes.
- **Part 1:** Standard function implementations (e.g., `memset`, `atoi`, `strncpy`).
- **Part 2:** Additional functions to extend functionality (e.g., linked list manipulations).
- **Bonus Part:** Advanced features and functions for list manipulation.

**🤝 Contributions and Adaptations:**
- Contributions and improvements to Libft are encouraged.
- Adapt the library to suit specific project requirements.
- Share and collaborate within the 42 community.

**📜 License:**
Libft is typically licensed under the MIT License, allowing for open collaboration and use.

Happy coding with your expanded Libft! 🚀

# <div align="center"> ft_printf function </div>

## Overview 📝

Welcome to the ft_printf project! In this assignment, the goal is to recode the `printf()` function from the C library. This project provides an excellent opportunity to enhance your programming skills by working with variadic functions in C. Upon completion, you can integrate your `ft_printf()` into your libft, making it accessible for use in other school C projects.

## Introduction 🚀

You'll delve into the implementation of the widely-used and versatile C function, `printf()`. This exercise is of moderate difficulty and offers insights into variadic functions in C. The key to success in this project lies in writing well-structured and extensible code.

### Key Learnings:
- Recoding the `printf()` function from libc.
- Utilizing variable numbers of arguments.
- Implementing various conversion specifiers.

## Requirements 📋

### Function Prototype:
```c
int ft_printf(const char *, ...);
```

## Conversions to Implement 🔄

1. **%c:** Prints a single character.
2. **%s:** Prints a string (as defined by the common C convention).
3. **%p:** Prints the `void *` pointer argument in hexadecimal format.
4. **%d:** Prints a decimal (base 10) number.
5. **%i:** Prints an integer in base 10.
6. **%u:** Prints an unsigned decimal (base 10) number.
7. **%x:** Prints a number in hexadecimal (base 16) lowercase format.
8. **%X:** Prints a number in hexadecimal (base 16) uppercase format.
9. **%%:** Prints a percent sign.

## Getting Started 🚀

To begin working on the `ft_printf` project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Implement the `ft_printf` function according to the specified requirements.
3. Use the `ar` command to create the library (`libftprintf.a`).
4. Test your implementation against the original `printf()` for comparison.

# <div align="center"> 42 C++ Modules (CPP05 - CPP09) </div>

This repository contains my implementations for the advanced modules of the 42 C++ curriculum, CPP05 to CPP09. Each module focuses on a key concept in C++ programming, progressing through exception handling, type casting, templates, and container management.

## **Modules Overview**

### **CPP05 - Try/Catch and Exceptions**
- **Summary**: This module is designed to help you understand exception handling in C++ using `try`, `catch`, and `throw`.
- **Topics Covered**:
  - Handling Errors with Exceptions
  - Creating and Throwing Custom Exceptions
  - Best Practices for Error Management
- **[Directory Link](./cpp05/)**: [cpp05](./cpp05/)

### **CPP06 - Type Casting**
- **Summary**: This module focuses on understanding and using the different types of type casting in C++.
- **Topics Covered**:
  - `static_cast`
  - `dynamic_cast`
  - `reinterpret_cast`
- **[Directory Link](./cpp06/)**: [cpp06](./cpp06/)

### **CPP07 - Templates**
- **Summary**: This module introduces templates and their role in generic programming in C++.
- **Topics Covered**:
  - Function Templates  
  - Class Templates
- **[Directory Link](./cpp07/)**: [cpp07](./cpp07/)

### **CPP08 - Templated Containers, Iterators, and Algorithms**
- **Summary**:  This module helps you understand and work with templated containers, iterators, and algorithms provided by the C++ Standard Template Library (STL).
- **Topics Covered**:
  - STL Containers: vector, map, stack, queue, and more
  - Iterators and Iterator Traits
  - STL Algorithms: `find`, `sort`, `for_each`, etc.
- **[Directory Link](./cpp08/)**: [cpp08](./cpp08/)

### **CPP09 - Containers**
- **Summary**: Focuses on abstract classes and interfaces to define and enforce subtype polymorphism.
- **Topics Covered**:
  - C++ Standard Containers
  - Container Design and Implementation
  - Advanced Container Operations
- **[Directory Link](./cpp09/)**: [cpp09](./cpp09/)
